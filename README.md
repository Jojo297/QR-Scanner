**In-App QR-Scanner** is a smart solution designed to scan QR codes directly from your screen, eliminating the need for frustrating manual steps like taking screenshots or switching between apps.

## 🚀 Problem & Solution

The "traditional" process often creates friction for users:
1. Encountering a QR code on social media or a mobile browser.
2. Taking a **Screenshot**.
3. Opening a separate QR Scanner app.
4. Uploading the image from the gallery.

**In-App QR-Scanner eliminates these steps.** By using a **Floating Scanner**, users can scan any code visible on their screen instantly with a single tap.

## ✨ Key Features

* **⚡ High-Speed Scanning:** Significantly reduces context switching between applications.
* **🔘 Floating Overlay:** A transparent icon (similar to iOS Assistive Touch) that stays accessible at the edge of the screen.
* **🎯 Screen Capture Recognition:** Reads QR codes directly from the current display content.
* **♿ Accessibility First:** Simplifies interaction for users with varying levels of technological skills.
* **📈 User Retention:** Improves efficiency by allowing users to stay within their current task or app.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Overlay Permission:** Grant the "Appear on Top" permission so the app can display the floating button.
2.  **Activate Mode:** Enable the feature within the main application.
3.  **Seamless Scanning:** Open any app (Instagram, browser, concert posters, etc.), tap the floating icon, and the scan result will be processed immediately.
